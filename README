== Welcome to NashvilleRB

We are trying to build an app for the nashville rb site to be hosted. Some of the tasks that need to be completed and will be created as issues are:

* The usage of S3 turned in to an appropriate plugin (right now I have it scattered as a direct modification of the plugins)
* The usage of Heroku as a host (which requires S3) but also requires we use the #{RAILS_ROOT}/tmp directory for caching (again, I directly modified the plugins)
* A Good Design
